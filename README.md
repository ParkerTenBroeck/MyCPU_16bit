# MyCPU_16bit
A 16 bit SAP-1 CPU that I designed in grade 10

All files are left as I left them in grade 10, I have no intention to work/improve
on these files. but I may eventually complete all instructions and implement an assembler
and disassembler for this ISA. 

The ISA and architecture is based on Ben Eaters SAP-1 CPU https://eater.net/8bit
